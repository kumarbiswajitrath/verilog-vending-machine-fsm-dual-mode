# verilog-vending-machine-fsm-dual-mode
This Verilog project implements a finite state machine (FSM)-based vending machine controller supporting both manual and auto-bulk dispensing modes. It handles multiple coin denominations, buy and refund logic, change return, and mode selection via a clean and modular design.
